# Flower Power Music react app

This is [basic music app](https://flower-power-music.netlify.app/) that uses Spotify API to help users create, listen to and save playlist in their accounts.

It allows users to log in with their Spotify credentials, upload playlists of 60-70s rock songs, add/remove tracks to a list  and save the favorite list to their Spotify account.

This project is part of a off-line challenge from a Codecademy's Frontend developer path.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features
Here's a quick summary of the functionalities in the app:

- Welcome page with login via Spotify account
- Home screen with a button "Get random 10 songs" that uploads tracks from Spotify
- Search results - 10 random songs from 60-70th category
- When results appear button changes to "Show another songs" - and uploads new random 10 songs
- Each track in the list has a preview sound - users can listen to all songs
- Each track is rendered in its individual box containing relevant info about it
- Users can add tracks to favorite list and remove from it

## Technologies
